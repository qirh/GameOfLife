cscie65 - Assignment 4
Summer 2017

Notes:
	As far as I know, I have implemented everything except:
		* still no panning gestures.
		* tapping an alive cell kills it.
		* not sure if this statement is true for my code "The Model/View/Controller pattern shown in the sample code must be followed".
		* not sure if this statement is true for my code "To implement the cells, you must override drawRect and use UIBezierPath drawn shapes and not internal UIViews".
Extras:
		* Added two experimental configurations in the shape of buttons.

Graduate Credit (* = done, ** = not done):
		* Variable size from 8 until 70. (Arbitrary values).

Insane (* = done, ** = not done):
	** Implement a landscape orientation as well.
	** Look up NSCoder, use it to persist the current state of your simulation to disk, and bring it back on startup.
	** Optimize calculation by avoiding recalculation of dead zones.

Known Bugs:
	As of now, no known bugs.
