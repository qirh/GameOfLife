// Convenience method to see how to count neighbors. You may copy this
// into your solution. Node 'grid' is a 2-D array of 'CellState's.

// Count the neighbors of a cell, treating the grid as a if it were
// wrapped around both the X and Y axes, so it becomes effectively a
// doughnut. Effectively, a cell at the leftmost boundary has as its
// neighbor the cell on the same row at the rightmost
// boundary. Similar for top and bottom.

// Challenge here is to translate a raw point value (say, for
// the x component, from 0 to myCustomView.bounds.width) into a
// logical grid value, in order to correctly mutate the model.
// For now we'll just use debugging prints to demonstrate the API.

// Note that we're using the parent class because it might be a UITapGR or a UIPanGR
