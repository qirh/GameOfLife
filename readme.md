# Conway's Game of Life
	just a small project that I worked on while learning iOS and Swift.

## Notes:
	As far as I know, I have implemented everything except:
		* Not sure if this code is an example of MVC, I need to look that up.
		* Added three experimental configurations in the shape of buttons.
		* Variable board size from 8 until 70. (Arbitrary values).

## Known Bugs:
		* It does get a bit laggy when the simulation runs for a while, I think it has something to do with how I handle drawing, since it probably is just drawing over the canvas over and over.

## To be Added (Ojal√°):
		* Force touch, still working on it.
		* Landscape orientation.
