cscie65 - Assignment 3
Summer 2017

Notes:
I had to change the data model today and fix a lot of problems from the last project, so I never got to finishing the navigation proper, I’ll work on it tonight and tomorrow, even if it won’t count for credit. Sorry if some portions of code are not commented well, I added all the sources that I used, except the professor’s notes and code.

Known Bugs:
	fixed all known bugs!
	However, the images feature is not implemented at all.

Thank you
